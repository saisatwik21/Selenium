MANUAL TESTING:
TESTING IS A PROCESS OF EXECUTING A SYSTEM OR A PROGRAM AND INTENDED TO FIND AN ERROR. (OR) TO DETECT THE ERRORS WE GO FOR TESTING. 
THE TESTING CAN BE DONE EITHER BY MANUAL OR AUTOMATION
MANUALLY BY GENERATING TEST CASES EITHER IN EXCEL SHEET OR TEST MANAGEMENT TOOLS OR BUG TRACKING TOOLS.
AUTOMATION BY ENHANCING TEST SCRIPTS.
WHY DO WE REQUIRE TESTING?
TO ANALYZE A QUALITY ON PRODUCT OR APPLICATION. WE REQUIRE TEST
QUALITY:
REQUIREMENT MEETS THE SPECIFICATIONS OR CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRODUCT AND APPLICATION:
PRODUCT: A SOFTWARE WHICH RESPONDS WITH RESPECT TO GLOBAL SPECIFICATIONS.
EX; HP,HCL,IBM,WIPRO.
APPLICATION: A SOFTWARE WHICH RESPONDS WRT CLIENT SPECIFICATIONS
THESE APPLICATIONS CAN BE DESIGNED BY USING WEB TECHNOLOGIES LIKE JAVA,RUBY,PYTHON,PERL,PHP AND SEA SHARP
SOME OF THE APPLICATIONS ARE WEB  APPLICATIONS,SCIENTIFIC APPLICATIONS,AERONAUTICAL APPLICATIONS,EMBEDDED APPLICATIONS,
MATHEMATICAL APPLICATIONS,GAMES AND WNDOW APPLICATIONS AND DESKTOP APPLICATIONS.
EX:

SDLC(INFORMATION GATHERING,ANALYSIS,DESIGN,CODING,TESTING,IMPLEMENTATION,MAINTAINANCE)
