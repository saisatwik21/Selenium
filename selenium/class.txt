//classes and objects
class is a collection of data member and member function

data member: the variables which are declared inside a class are known as a data member

example:

class class_name
{
	public void methodname //member function
	{
	string variable //data member
	}
}

member function: the functions which are declared inside a class are known as a member function
example:
class Operations
{
	public void add()
	{
		int a=10,b=20;
		int c=a+b;
		s.o.p("add"+c);
	}
	public void sub()
	{
		int a=10,b=20;
		int c=a-b;
		s.o.p("sub"+c);
	}
	public void mul()
	{
		int a=10,b=20;
		int c=a*b;
		s.o.p("mul"+c);
	}
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		Operations op=new Operations();
		op.add();
		op.sub();
		op.mul();
	}
}
